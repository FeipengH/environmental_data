#Q7 The shape of the histogram becomes more skewed.
#Q8 The shape of the histogram resembles more of a normal distribution.
#Q9 The shape of the histogram resembles more of a normal distribution. It is narrower than what I got in Q7.
#Q10 When the sample size is one, the sample mean is that one number. When the sample size is two, we can calculate a mean and have a better approximation.
